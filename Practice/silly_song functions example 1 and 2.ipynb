    "1. We create a Python script named `silly_song.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inside the script, we define two functions:\n",
    "   - `sing_refrain()`: This function prints the refrain of a silly pop culture song.\n",
    "   - `sing_verse(lineage)`: This function prints a verse of the same song with the specified lineage name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We also define the `main()` function, which serves as the entry point of our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inside the `main()` function, we print a message to indicate that we are about to sing a silly song.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We call the `sing_verse()` function three times, each with a different lineage name (\"Mommy,\" \"Daddy,\" and \"Grandma\") to create humorous variations of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, we call the `sing_refrain()` function to sing the iconic and silly pop  refrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example extensions:\n",
    "1. break out the refrain and the main verse into a separate file and using function importing.\n",
    "See files silly_functions.py and silly_song.py for example of This (example 2 below)\n",
    "2. See using module function aliases (example 4 below)\n",
