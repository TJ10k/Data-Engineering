    "# Python File Modes\n",
    "File modes in Python dictate how a file is opened and what operations can be performed on it. Here is a breakdown of common file modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (Read): Opens a file for reading. It is the default mode if no mode is specified. Raises an error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write): Opens a file for writing. If the file exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append): Opens a file for appending. Data is written to the end of the file. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Exclusive Creation): Opens a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, it raises a FileExistsError. If the file does not exist, it creates it \n",
    "and opens it for writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary): Used with other modes to open a file in binary mode. For example, 'rb' opens a file for reading in binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' (Text): The default mode. Opens a file in text mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'+' (Read and Write): Used with other modes to allow both reading and writing. For example, 'r+' opens a file for both reading and writing, starting from the beginning of the file. 'w+' also allows both reading and writing but truncates the file first. 'a+' opens a file for both appending and reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modes can be combined, for instance:\n",
    "'rb': Opens a binary file for reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "'wt': Opens a text file for writing (same as 'w').\n",
    "\n",
    "'r+': Opens a file for both reading and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a+': Opens a file for both appending and reading.\n"
