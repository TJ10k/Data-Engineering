    "\n",
    "Say we start with three tables - character, character_tv_show and character_actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get each character name with his/her TV show name, we can write:\n",

    "Sometimes you may want to get all of the character names, even if there isn't corresponding data for the actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "A left join returns all data from the first, or left table, and puts NULL in columns where there is no data from the right table.\n",
